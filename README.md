A simple currency conversion bot.

You will need the bot token for the code to work, place it in the config.py file along with a dictionary of currencies you would like to convert using this bot.

The keys are stored in the config.py along with the token file in the dictionary, for example:
TOKEN = "YOUR_TOKEN"
keys = {
    "Dollar": "USD",
    "Yuan": "CNY",
    "Ruble": "RUB",
    "Euro": "EUR"
}
